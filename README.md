## Vending Machine Simulation Project

This repository contains the backup for my Real-Time Computing course project. The project simulates a vending machine using an Arduino Uno, an LCD display, buttons for product selection and coin insertion, and a buzzer for audio feedback.

### Project Description

The vending machine simulation allows users to:
- Insert coins to increase their balance.
- Select between two products: a beverage or a snack.
- Purchase a selected product if the balance is sufficient.
- Display the remaining stock of each product.
- Show an "Out Of Stock!" message if a selected product is unavailable.
- Show a "Please insert correct amount" message if the balance is insufficient.

The project utilizes four buttons: one for confirming the purchase, one for simulating coin insertion, and two for selecting the products. The buttons are connected to the digital pins of the Arduino using pull-up resistors. The LCD display shows the current balance, the selected product, and the remaining stock of each product. The buzzer provides audio feedback during the dispensing process.
